Deployment Guide for 837 Transactions
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the 837 transactions using AWS CodeBuild, Ansible, and CDK.

Prerequisites
Access to the AWS Console with the appropriate role.
Knowledge of the environment to be deployed (e.g., dev, prod).
Ensure required dependencies and configurations are set up:
CodeBuild project (deploy-dev or relevant environment project).
Infrastructure stack code in place.
DB scripts, if specified.
Deployment Steps
1. Log in to the AWS Console
Open the AWS Console.
Assume the correct IAM role for deployment.
2. Select the Deployment Project
Navigate to CodeBuild in the AWS Console.
Search for the project corresponding to the environment (e.g., deploy-dev).
3. Start the Build with Overrides
Select the Start Build button for the project.
In the Start Build dialog:
Source Override: Specify the appropriate source repository.
Environment Variables:
Key: INCLUDE_PROJ_LIST
Value: deploy_837
4. Include DB Scripts (If Applicable)
If DB scripts are required, include them in the build overrides:
text
Copy code
Key: INCLUDE_PROJ_LIST
Value: deploy_837,dbscripts
5. Start the Build
Confirm all overrides and variables are set correctly.
Click Start Build to begin the deployment.
Deployment Details
The deployment process includes the following steps:

The buildspec file defines the build instructions.
The app.py script is executed to deploy the following stacks:
837 Batch Stack: Deploys resources for batch processing.
Image Lambdas Stack: Deploys Lambda functions for image processing.
Python Lambdas Stack: Deploys Python-based Lambda functions.
Step Function Stack: Deploys AWS Step Functions workflows.
Wrapper Step Function Stack: Deploys additional wrapper workflows.
Post-Deployment Validation
Monitor the Build Logs in CodeBuild for any errors.
Verify that the stacks are deployed successfully:
Go to AWS CloudFormation in the console.
Check the status of the deployed stacks (CREATE_COMPLETE or UPDATE_COMPLETE).
Test the deployed application or transaction in the environment.
Troubleshooting
Build Fails in CodeBuild
Check the logs for errors related to the buildspec file or app.py.
Verify that the correct environment variables and source overrides were provided.
Stack Deployment Issues
Check the CloudFormation Events tab for specific stack errors.
Review the output of app.py for debugging information.
