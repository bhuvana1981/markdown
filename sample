To upgrade Nexus Repository Manager from version 3.69 with OrientDB to the latest version 3.75, follow these steps: First, back up the Nexus installation and data directories, including the OrientDB database. Upgrade to Nexus 3.70.x, as it is the last version supporting OrientDB. Once upgraded, set up the new database, preferably PostgreSQL for production or H2 for smaller environments. Update the Nexus configuration file to point to the new database and use the migration tool provided by Sonatype to transfer data from OrientDB. After successfully migrating the database, upgrade to Nexus 3.75, ensuring that Java 17 is installed as it is required for this version. Validate the installation by checking system logs, repository functionality, and overall system performance. This step-by-step process ensures a smooth upgrade while maintaining system integrity and compatibility.
